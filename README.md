# headbrackets
Have to prototype them somehow! If you use this, cite us please! 
Not sure about the licensing so I just chose MIT here(not that I put too much thought into that).  


Made in Solidworks Education

I can export AutoCAD files but I do not believe it does it percectly.


These were designed to be used with Neuropixels Chronic recordings.


I made a head bracket (KeyFit) for the olfactory bulb and hippocampus for recording in both regions at the same time.

(for now the olfactory bulb one is a but long but I'm experimenting with how short I can make it)



If you see any discrepancies, reachout!
